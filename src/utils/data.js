Tanya Peterson was 25 when she saw this duck, she reported, "It was quite a friendly little fellow. At no time did I feel any fear. I stayed with him for maybe 15 or 20 minutes, then zoom! He zipped out of the water and across the night sky like a comet.',

Thomas Maltese and his family were camping in New Jersey in the summer of 1962, "I had just put the kids to bed when I heard a rustling sound in the nearby brush. I shined my flashlight and there it was, the neck must have been 3 feet long. I still remember the quacking. Oh the terrible, terrible quacking. My life changed the night."',
